# Introduction

Rust comes with a simple yet powerful test suite built into the language. This unit will explore how
we can write different test strategies to ensure our program's correctness even further.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn:

- How to write unit tests
- How to write integration tests
- How to write documentation tests

## Prerequisites

For this learning module you'll need a development environment already set up. If you need to review
how to acheive that you can take a look at our first learning module: "Get started with Rust".
