# Learn about unit tests

Unit Tests in Rust are simple functions marked with the `#[test]` attribute that verify that the non-test code is functioning in the expected manner. These functions are only compiled when testing our code.

The bodies of test functions typically perform some setup, run the code we want to test, then assert whether the results are what we expect.

In the code example below we define a simple `add` function and another `add_works` function marked with the `#[test]` attribute.

```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

#[test]
fn add_works() {
    assert_eq!(add(1, 2), 3);
    assert_eq!(add(10, 12), 22);
    assert_eq!(add(5, -2), 3);
}
```

When we execute the command `$ cargo test`, our output would the following:

```output
running 1 test
test add_works ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

## Test failures

Lets try to include a failing test, just to see how `cargo tests` behaves.

```rust
#[test]
fn add_fails() {
    assert_eq!(add(2, 2), 7);
}
```

If we ran the tests again using the `$ cargo test` command, the output should point out that our `add_works` test passed and `add_fails` failed, with the detail of the failed call to `assert_eq`.

```output
running 2 tests
test add_works ... ok
test add_fails ... FAILED

failures:

---- add_fails stdout ----
thread 'add_fails' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
  left: `4`,
 right: `7`', src/main.rs:14:5
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace


failures:
    add_fails

test result: FAILED. 1 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

## Expected failures

In many scenarios it's important to test if a condition will cause a `panic!`.

We can do this by adding another attribute, `should_panic`, to our test function. This attribute makes a test pass if the code inside the function panics, and makes the test fail if the code inside the function doesnâ€™t panic.

Now, our `add_fails` test function can capture an expected panic and treat it as a passing test.

```rust
#[test]
#[should_panic]
fn add_fails() {
    assert_eq!(add(2, 2), 7);
}
```

And our tests results will be:

```output
running 2 tests
test add_works ... ok
test add_fails ... ok

test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

## Ignoring tests

A function annotated with the `[test]` attribute can also be annotated with the `[ignore]`
attribute. This causes that test function to be skipped during tests.

The `[ignore]` attribute may optionally be written with a reason why the test is ignored.

```rust
#[test]
#[ignore = "not yet reviewed by the Q.A. team"]
fn add_negatives() {
    assert_eq!(add(-2, -2), -4)
}
```

Ignored test functions will still be type-checked and compiled but won't be executed in our tests.

```output
running 3 tests
test add_negatives ... ignored
test add_works ... ok
test add_fails ... ok

test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 1 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

## The test module

Most unit tests go into a submodule with the `#[cfg(test)]` attribute.

```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod add_function_tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn add_works() {
        assert_eq!(add(1, 2), 3);
        assert_eq!(add(10, 12), 22);
        assert_eq!(add(5, -2), 3);
    }

    #[test]
    #[should_panic]
    fn add_fails() {
        assert_eq!(add(2, 2), 7);
    }

    #[test]
    #[ignore]
    fn add_negatives() {
        assert_eq!(add(-2, -2), -4)
    }
}
```

The `cfg` attribute controls conditional compilation, and will only compile the thing it is attached to if the predicate is `true`. The `test` compilation flag is issued automatically by Cargo whenever we execute the command `$ cargo run`, so it will always be true when we run our tests.

The `use super::*;` declaration is necessary for the code inside the `add_funtcion_tests` module to access the `add` in the outer module.
