# Write documentation tests

With Rust, you can execute documentation examples as tests. The primary way of documenting a Rust library is through annotating the source code with triple forward slashes *(///)*, known as *documentation comments*. Documentation comments are written in markdown and support code blocks in them, so these code blocks are compiled and used as tests.

To try out this feature, you'll need to create a new library project first.

```sh
$ cargo new --lib basic_math
$ cd basic_math
```

Open the file `src/lib.rs` in Visual Studio Code and replace the existing contents with the following code:

```rust
/// Generally, the first line is a brief summary describing the function.
///
/// The next lines present detailed documentation. 
/// Code blocks start with triple backticks. The code has an implicit `fn main()` inside and `extern crate <cratename>`,  
/// which means you can just start writing code.
///
/// ```
/// let result = basic_math::add(2, 3);
/// assert_eq!(result, 5);
/// ```
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

Like unit tests, doc tests will pass if they run without panicking. To verify certain results, use an *assert!* macro to verify the actual output is as expected.  You can call the test suite for this code with the command `$ cargo test`, and the output would look like this:

```output
$ cargo test
    Finished test [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
     Running target/debug/deps/basic_math-910b859a2a6f3c3f

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out

   Doc-tests basic_math

running 1 test
test src/lib.rs - add (line 6) ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

Notice that the output indicates that there are 0 unit tests and 1 doc test.
