# Exercise - Write documentation tests

In this exercise you'll create documentation tests in the code snippet below for the functions `div` and `sub`.

For the `div` function write the following doctests:

  1. assert that `10` divided by `2` equals `5`
  2. assert that `6` divided by `3` equals `2`
  3. assert that `10` divided by `0` panics

For the `sub` function write the following doctests:

  1. assert that `9` subtracted by `2` equals `7`
  2. assert that `6` subtracted by `9` equals `-3`

```rust
/// This function divides two numbers.
///
/// # Example #1: 10 / 2 == 5
///
/// ```
/// let result = doctests_exercise::div(...);  // TODO: finish this test!
/// assert_eq!(result, 2);
/// ```
///
/// # Example #2: 6 / 2 = 3
///
/// ```
/// TODO: Write this doctest!
/// ```
///
/// # Panics
///
/// The function panics if the second argument is zero.
///
/// ```rust,should_panic
/// // panics on division by zero
/// TODO: Write this doctest!
/// ```
pub fn div(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    if b == 0 {
        panic!("Divide-by-zero error");
    }
    a / b
}

/// This function subtracts two numbers.
///
/// # Example #1: 9 - 2 == 7
///
/// ```
/// TODO: Write this doctest!
/// ```
///
/// # Example #2: 6 - 9 == -3
///
/// ```
/// TODO: Write this doctest!
/// ```
pub fn sub(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a - b
}
```

Remember to create the project in your computer first, as documentation tests are only available for library crates. You can run the following commands in your terminal to accomplish this:

```sh
$ cargo new --lib doctests_exercise
$ cd doctests_exercise
```

Keep in mind that the name of the crate must prefix the name of the function, as it is already filled in for the first assignment of this exercise.
