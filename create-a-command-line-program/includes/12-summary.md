# Summary

Congratulations! You have just finished writing a modern rust command line application! With the journal application you can: add new tasks to a list, remove completed tasks, and print all the outstanding tasks.

You can now compile the program in *release* mode and share your compiled program with whe world. To do that, go to the terminal and run the command: `cargo run --release`.

The compiled binary *(executable)* will be inside the `target/release/` directory, named after our project name. If you are using MacOS or Linux, it will be called `rusty-journal`, and if you are using Windows it will be named `rusty-journal.exe`.

You can call it from your command line directly now, no need for cargo anymore! Just make sure that its directory is listed in your `PATH` environment variable.
