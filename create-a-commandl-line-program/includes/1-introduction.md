# Introduction

In this final module, we'll develop a modern, real-world Rust program.

Our application will be a command-line to-do tracker that records our
tasks into a text file, display them as a list in the terminal and
lets us mark them complete.

## Prerequisites

We will require all the knowledge we have gathered so far, so don't
hesitate to review past units as we move along.

Also, since our command line app will require the use of multiple
files and in user interaction from the terminal, *Rust Playground* can
not be used this time.
