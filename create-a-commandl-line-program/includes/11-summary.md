# Summary

Congratulations! You have just finished writing a modern rust command line application!

You can now compile it in *release* mode and share your compiled program with whe world:

```
cargo run --release
```

The compiled binary *(executable)* will be inside the `target/release/` directory, named after our
project name. If you are using MacOS or Linux, it will be called `rusty-journal`, and if you are
using Windows it will be named `rusty-journal.exe`.

You can call it from your command line directly now, no need for cargo anymore. Just make sure that
its direcory is listed in your `PATH` environment variable.
