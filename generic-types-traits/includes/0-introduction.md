In this module, you're going to discover **Traits** and **Generics**, which are Rust's way to deal
with the concept of *polymorphism*. Together, they allow us to write code that act on values of many
different types, even types that haven't been declared yet.

# Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn:

-   What Generic types are and how "wrapper" types uses them.
-   What Traits are and how they help us define shared behaviour.
-   How to implement an existing Trait for a custom type.
-   How to implement a custom Trait for an existing type.
-   What are trait bounds and how they help us write generic functions.

# Prerequisites

- To understand this chapter, you must have understood Rust's Type System concepts and have
consolidated your understanding of Move Semantics.
