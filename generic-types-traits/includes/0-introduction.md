In this module, you're going to discover **traits** and **generics**, which are Rust's way to deal
with the concept of *polymorphism*. Together, they allow us to write code that act on values of many
different types, even types that haven't been declared yet.

# Learning Objectives

In this module, you'll learn:

- What generic types are and how "wrapper" types uses them.
- What traits are and how they help us define shared behavior.
- How to implement an existing trait for a custom type.
- How to implement a custom trait for an existing type.
- How trait bounds help us write generic functions.

# Prerequisites

- Have a solid understanding of Rust's types, ownerships, and moves. If you have any questions about those topics, please review the module: **Understand ownership, borrowing and lifetimes**.
