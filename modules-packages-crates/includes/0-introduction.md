# Introduction

Up until now, we've written programs as single-file modules. But as our programs grow, we can do better and organize our code into multiple modules, files and even packages.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn:

- How to organize your code in files, modules and packages.
- How those concepts interact.
- How to use third-party packages from the [Crates.io](https://crates.io) repository.

## Prerequisites

- Have your Rust development environment already set up.
- Know how to create, edit, and run Rust code by using Cargo.
