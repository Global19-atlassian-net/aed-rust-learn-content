# Introduction

Up until now, we'v written programs as single-file modules. But when our programs start to grow, we
can do better and organize our code into multiple modules, files and even packages.

# Learning Objectives

In this module, you'll learn:

-   How to organize your code in files, modules and packages.
-   How those concepts interact.
-   How to use third-party packages from the [Crates.io](https://crates.io) repository.

# Prerequisites

For this learning module you'll need a development environment already set up. If you need to review
how to acheive that you can take a look at our first learning module: "Get started with Rust".
