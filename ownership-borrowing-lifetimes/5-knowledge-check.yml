  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What is the meaning of the `<'a>` segment in the following struct declaration? `struct Nominee<'a> { person: &'a Person }`" 
    choices:
    - content: "It means that the `Nominee` struct will live no longer than the `Person` value it borrows from."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `Nominee` struct can't live longer than the `Person` value it borrows."
    - content: "It means that the `Nominee` struct will live no longer than the `AwardKind` value it borrows from."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The field `award` owns the `AwardKind` value, so no borrow occurs."
    - content: "It means that the `Nominee` struct will live no longer than the `String` value it holds."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The field `contribution` owns the `String` value, so no borrow occurs."
    - content: "It means that the `Nominee` struct can have an optional value in its `person` field."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `person` field requires a reference to a `Person` value and it is not optional."
  - content: "What type of aliasing is permitted in Rust?"
    choices:
    - content: "One mutable reference and multiple immutable references."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The compiler won't allow any mutable reference to exist while immutable references are present."
    - content: "One mutable reference or multiple immutable references."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Rust forbids the combination of aliasing and mutation on the same location."
    - content: "Many mutable references and no immutable references."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The compiler won't allow many mutable references to the same value, even if there is no immutable references."
    - content: "Many mutable and immutable references."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The compiler won't allow many mutable references to the same value, let alone combining mutable with immutable references."
