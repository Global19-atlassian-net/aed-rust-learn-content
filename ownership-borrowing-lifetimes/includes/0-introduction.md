# Introduction
In this module we are going to discover one of Rust's most powerful features: the Borrow Checker.

It enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector, unlike many
other languages.

# Learning Objectives

In this module, you will learn about:

-   Rust's pointer types, commonly called References.
-   The concept of ownership in Rust.
-   Moving and borrowing values.
-   Scoping rules and Lifetimes

# Prerequisites

-   You should have a basic understanding of Rust's primitive and collection types, as covered in the previous modules.
