  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following statements is incorrect?"
    choices:
    - content: "In Rust, variables are immutable by default."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Variables in Rust are immutable by default, meaning their value can't be changed."
    - content: "All integer types can be either positive or negative."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Signed integers can represent positive and negative numbers, while unsigned integers can represent only positive
numbers."
    - content: "Tuples can contain elements of different types."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A tuple is a grouping of values of different types collected into one compound."
    - content: "Arrays and Vectors can only hold values from a single type."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Arrays and vectors is a collection of objects that allow you to store multiple values of the same type."
  - content: "Which data structure would be the best fit for representing an address-book, that associates
people's names to their phone numbers?"
    choices:
    - content: "A Tuple."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A tuple will just allow you to group values into one compound. We could have a combined tuple of names and phone numbers, but wouldn't be able to easily map them together."
    - content: "A Vector."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A vector will just allow you to store a collection of objects. You wouldn't know how to relate a person's name to their phone number."
    - content: "An Array."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An array is a collection of similar objects. You wouldn't know how to relate a person's name to their phone number."
    - content: "A HashMap."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A hashmap allows you to store a mapping of keys to values. So each name key could have a corresponding phone number as a value."
  - content: "What would happen if you tried to directly access an element of a vector whose index was beyond that
vector's boundaries?"
    choices:
    - content: "The program would panic in runtime."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The program will panic and terminate with an 'index out of bounds' error."
    - content: "A null value would be returned."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No value of any kind can be returned if it doesn't exist."
    - content: "A compilation error."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Almost. The program will compile successfully and then return an error when the vector is accessed with an index that's not in range."
    - content: "The last element of this vector would be returned instead."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The vector will not successfully return an index that is not specified or does not exist."
